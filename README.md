#PCF Parser

This script takes a .csv representation of the PCF and creates a nested JSON object out of it.

##Usage

- Clone this repo or download `pcf2json.js`
- Create an empty directory, and fill it up with .csv files for each section of the PCF. Example: `1.csv`, `2.csv`, etc. (Names don't matter)
- Run `pcf2json.js` from inside the directory you just created. The script will parse and concatenate all files into a single JSON file in this dir.

##CSV Formatting

Each CSV should be stripped of all data except each element and its children. Remove titles, descriptions, and all that jazz. It should look something like this:

~~~
10002,1.0 Develop Vision and Strategy (10002),,,
10014,,1.1 Define the business concept and long-term vision (10014),,
10017,,,1.1.1 Assess the external environment (10017),
10021,,,,1.1.1.1 Analyze and evaluate competition (10021)
10022,,,,1.1.1.2 Identify economic trends (10022)
10023,,,,1.1.1.3 Identify political and regulatory issues (10023)
10024,,,,1.1.1.4 Assess new technology innovations (10024)
10025,,,,1.1.1.5 Analyze demographics (10025)
10026,,,,1.1.1.6 Identify social and cultural changes (10026)
10027,,,,1.1.1.7 Identify ecological concerns (10027)
10018,,,1.1.2 Survey market and determine customer needs and wants (10018),
~~~

Depth in the framework is determined by empty cells (between the commas in the above example), so preserve those empty cells.

##TODO

- Create a way to name the framework and provide a description for it
- Create a way to specify the filename generated by the script
